\begin{frame}{Quick Question}
  How many are familiar with this topic?
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{A Joke}
  This is not a \texttt{m-} tutorial.

  \pause

  Nor is it a \texttt{lens} tutorial
  \pause
  (aka the new new \texttt{m-} tutorial...

  \pause
  ...because \texttt{arrows} \textit{were} the new \texttt{m-} tutorials).

\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{About This Talk}
    \texttt{Agda}, \texttt{Idris}, \texttt{Coq} and co$^*$ have full support for dependent types.\\
    \pause
    Because of that, it's harder to see the build up, so we won't be directly using them in this talk.\\
    \pause
    \textit{\tiny{Honestly though, it's because they're way over my head :(}}\\
    \textit{\tiny{(*) There was another mini joke here...}}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{About This Talk}
  But we will be using \texttt{Haskell} though :)\\
  \pause
  It's not truely dependent, but we can do more and more with each \texttt{language extension} that comes along.\\
\end{frame}

  Syntax highlighting test reference, to be removed later.

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Test}
  Couldn't quite yet get listing to work with overlay yet.

  \begin{lstlisting}[style=hask]
      {- block comment -}
      @ffoo@ :: Bool -> Int -> String
      @ffoo@ False @vc0@ = "Bad"
      @ffoo@ True  @vc0@ = "Questionable"
      @ffoo@ False n = "Fake"
      @ffoo@ True  n = "Read"
  \end{lstlisting}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Test}
  Pausing within listing is ok?

  \begin{lstlisting}[style=hask]
    {-# LANGUAGE KitchenSink #-}
    @fzipWith@ :: (a -> b -> c) -> @vc[@a@vc]@ -> @vc[@b@vc]@ -> @vc[@c@vc]@ @|\pause@
    @fzipWith@ _ @vc[]@     _      = @vc[]@ @|\pause@
    @fzipWith@ _ _      @vc[]@     = @vc[]@ @|\pause@
    @fzipWith@ f (x@vc:@xs) (y@vc:@ys) = f x y @vc:@ @fzipWith@ f xs ys
  \end{lstlisting}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Values and Types}
  Values has types.\\
  Values are classified by types.\\
