- values has types
better to say values belong to a types
or values are classified by types

with that (and some other not as relevant stuff), we have lambda calculus
a classic example for a simple language that is Turing Complete


Extend lambda calculus to be able to do more things
what do we have so far?

values :: type, f :: a -> b
=> set of values to values
~> values depending on values!

what about:
values depending on types -> parametric polymorphism aka generics in OO terminology
types depending on types -> ???
types depending on values -> ???
